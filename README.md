Analyze and Explore the Climate Data

Reflecting tables into SQLAlchemy ORM is creating classes that correspond to the tables in the database.
So we can use these classes to access the database using Python code instead of writing SQL queries.
The automap_base() function in SQLAlchemy can be used to reflect tables into classes. 
Once the tables are reflected, we can save use variables for each table to access them with python.
